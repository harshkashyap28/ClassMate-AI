ClassMate AI is an AI-powered application designed to simplify and enhance the learning experience for students and faculty. The app includes features like attendance tracking, notes summarization, quiz generation, and assignment reminders. It is built using React for the front-end and Python for the back-end.

## Features

- **Attendance Tracking**: Automatically mark attendance by capturing a selfie, with location-based check-ins.
- **Notes Summarization**: Upload PDFs and receive summarized notes in a paragraph format.
- **Quiz Generation**: Create quizzes based on course notes or topics with customizable difficulty levels.
- **Assignment Reminder**: Get reminders about upcoming assignments with deadlines.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and medium deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
